## 28 May 2020 event 
1. Notes from the Panel
   1. Jason and Paul are skeptically cautious 
   1. Ginny: Realize the vote by mail isn’t a nationwide shift, states, individually are just expanding the absentees for this. Only 4 states now have ‘excuses’ and that’s a great thing
   1. Paul: every added layer of bureaucracy hurts getting the money to the people who actually need it. For example, HAVA requires a 20% match but some state legislatures haven’t been able to meet, so that’s a little prohibitive.  Confirm states who have submitted verses haven’t. 
1. Question List from audience
   1. Chris Faulkner - Assuming most states will expand voting by mail/absentee voting what steps should be taken, proactively, to help maintain the security of these ballots after they are received as well as verification of them?
   1. Betsy Mahan - If your Secy of State says there is no fraud, and does not appear to have conducted any investigation - other than filing lawsuits, who else can investigate? I'm in California…
   1. Marcia Robiou - I am curious where the panelists stand on prosecution of voter fraud cases. States appear to have different approaches. Some prosecute each violation of the election code to the fullest extent of the law and other states take a more lax approach. What’s the best approach and you can point to specific states that are doing it well or not well?
   1. Chris Faulkner - Considering the average age of the one day employee/volunteers who run polling sites…do you think we will be able to have enough staff at all of our current voting locations? If not what should we do?
   1. Marcia Robiou - How do panelists respond to the concern that this focus on voter fraud in vote-by-mail programs is missing the mark and the real election integrity concern is disinformation campaigns or interference (domestic or foreign)?
