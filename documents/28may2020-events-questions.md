## 28 May 2020 event questions


1. It seems to be human nature that when an important task takes longer than we expect or gives us a surprising result, we assume the worst. 
   1. Slow election reporting means fraud or does it? For example, risk limiting audits can delay election results, but improves the quality of the election results. Are the election reporting delays acceptable for oversight?
1. Commercial companies run complex networks of computer systems. Election systems do not have the same confidence and track record as the commercial systems.
   1. Is poorly maintained software or malfunctioning equipment a valid excuse for Election Day issues or should we expect a higher level of preparation when it comes to elections?
1. Online voting and electronic voting options in general are eschewed by some that prefer paper ballots. 
   1. Are mobile technology solutions such as mobile sample ballots to pre-populate ballot machines or mobile registration check-in applications acceptable?
1. Registering to vote absentee does not have uniform acceptance requirements or “excuses” from state to state. 
   1. What are the reasons for and against no excuse absentee voter registration?
1. Voter registration systems are increasing using county or statewide computer networks. 
   1. From some of the recent election primary problems, are we focusing enough attention on managing these complex systems? 
1. Notes from the Panel
   1. Jason and Paul are skeptically cautious 
   1. Ginny: Realize the vote by mail isn’t a nationwide shift, states, individually are just expanding the absentees for this. Only 4 states now have ‘excuses’ and that’s a great thing
   1. Paul: every added layer of bureaucracy hurts getting the money to the people who actually need it. For example, HAVA requires a 20% match but some state legislatures haven’t been able to meet, so that’s a little prohibitive.  Confirm states who have submitted verses haven’t. 
1. Question List from audience
   1. Chris Faulkner - Assuming most states will expand voting by mail/absentee voting what steps should be taken, proactively, to help maintain the security of these ballots after they are received as well as verification of them?
   1. Betsy Mahan - If your Secy of State says there is no fraud, and does not appear to have conducted any investigation - other than filing lawsuits, who else can investigate? I'm in California…
   1. Marcia Robiou - I am curious where the panelists stand on prosecution of voter fraud cases. States appear to have different approaches. Some prosecute each violation of the election code to the fullest extent of the law and other states take a more lax approach. What’s the best approach and you can point to specific states that are doing it well or not well?
   1. Chris Faulkner - Considering the average age of the one day employee/volunteers who run polling sites…do you think we will be able to have enough staff at all of our current voting locations? If not what should we do?
   1. Marcia Robiou - How do panelists respond to the concern that this focus on voter fraud in vote-by-mail programs is missing the mark and the real election integrity concern is disinformation campaigns or interference (domestic or foreign)?
