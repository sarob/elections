# 28 May 2020 event questions
1. The federal government established the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) in 2002 to improve Federal office elections administration, technology and security. Over $1B has been allocated for state HAVA grants since 2018 alone. The Brennan Center recently put out a paper highlighting that pandemic election costs require another $2B to be allocated. 
   1. Questions to Paul, with group follow up: How optimistic are you about the November election with the existing funding? 
   1. Is there enough focus on fraud avoidance in election systems and the grants that are funding them?
   1. Can the President directly or indirectly restructure HAVA funds or the way they are used?
1. Administrative errors and voter ballot mistakes are serious issues that can lead to fraud and cast doubt on the election system. Some counties have found that they have 90% or even above 100% voter registration numbers.There are regional tools available that could correct this type problem. At the same time, online voter registration is becoming more widely implemented across the US. 
   1. Questions to Jason, with group follow up:
   1. Is Utah’s approach of every state ID getting a ballot the best or worst approach to correct voter registration issues?
   1. Can a large voter information database be a compromise between the access and privacy concerns?
   1. You have pointed out that multiple counties had voter registration greater than 100%. Any thoughts on the best short term solution for those counties?
1. The Election Assistance Commission that oversees the HAVA grants has guidelines and gates for how and when funds are used by the states. The HAVA guidelines have some vagueness to them. There is a stated desire to provide the states flexibility in implementation. 
   1. Questions to the group:
   1. Are the Secretaries of State distributing the funds as intended?
   1. Are the funds being distributed in a timely manner to the local election justidictions? 
   1. Does the case for more election funds require more regulation and oversight than what exists today, e.g. March 2020 HR 6379 and May 2020 HR 6800?
1. Microsoft has been leading the development of an open source back end encryption project to secure the vote. Most recently, this ElectionGuard project has successfully in Wisconsin run a local election primary with the capability of a voter to verify their vote while keeping their ballot contents secret.
   1. Question to Ginny, with group follow up:
   1. Do we have parallels to absentee or vote by mail implementations? 
1. It’s been a common concern that absentee voting benefits one political party over another. Oregon has been running statewide vote by mail elections for over two decades. Recent research from Stanford is disputing the bias claim. 
   1. Question to Stan, with group follow up:
   1. Is the absentee bias claim overblown or is there more to understand from examples like Oregon?
1. Is fraud a bigger problem in Oregon than states with more restrictive absentee registration requirements?
   1. Metro areas usually have more funds for scanners that can do fast signature matching while rural areas are matching by eyeball and hand. Even Colorado has big differences between different counties. Can the more experienced counties in the short term help the rural counties use some of the latest round of grant money for solutions like this? Does signature verification technology play an outsized role in the metro versus rural elections capabilities to detect fraud in Oregon?
1. It seems to be human nature that when an important task takes longer than we expect or gives us a surprising result, we assume the worst. 
   1. Slow election reporting means fraud or does it? For example, risk limiting audits can delay election results, but improves the quality of the election results. Are the election reporting delays acceptable for oversight?
1. Commercial companies run complex networks of computer systems. Election systems do not have the same confidence and track record as the commercial systems.
   1. Is poorly maintained software or malfunctioning equipment a valid excuse for Election Day issues or should we expect a higher level of preparation when it comes to elections?
1. Online voting and electronic voting options in general are eschewed by some that prefer paper ballots. 
   1. Are mobile technology solutions such as mobile sample ballots to pre-populate ballot machines or mobile registration check-in applications acceptable?
1. Registering to vote absentee does not have uniform acceptance requirements or “excuses” from state to state. 
   1. What are the reasons for and against no excuse absentee voter registration?
1. Voter registration systems are increasing using county or statewide computer networks. 
   1. From some of the recent election primary problems, are we focusing enough attention on managing these complex systems? 
1. Notes from the Panel
   1. Jason and Paul are skeptically cautious 
   1. Ginny: Realize the vote by mail isn’t a nationwide shift, states, individually are just expanding the absentees for this. Only 4 states now have ‘excuses’ and that’s a great thing
   1. Paul: every added layer of bureaucracy hurts getting the money to the people who actually need it. For example, HAVA requires a 20% match but some state legislatures haven’t been able to meet, so that’s a little prohibitive.  Confirm states who have submitted verses haven’t. 
1. Question List from audience
   1. Chris Faulkner - Assuming most states will expand voting by mail/absentee voting what steps should be taken, proactively, to help maintain the security of these ballots after they are received as well as verification of them?
   1. Betsy Mahan - If your Secy of State says there is no fraud, and does not appear to have conducted any investigation - other than filing lawsuits, who else can investigate? I'm in California…
   1. Marcia Robiou - I am curious where the panelists stand on prosecution of voter fraud cases. States appear to have different approaches. Some prosecute each violation of the election code to the fullest extent of the law and other states take a more lax approach. What’s the best approach and you can point to specific states that are doing it well or not well?
   1. Chris Faulkner - Considering the average age of the one day employee/volunteers who run polling sites…do you think we will be able to have enough staff at all of our current voting locations? If not what should we do?
   1. Marcia Robiou - How do panelists respond to the concern that this focus on voter fraud in vote-by-mail programs is missing the mark and the real election integrity concern is disinformation campaigns or interference (domestic or foreign)?
